// Your task in this Kata is to emulate text justify right in monospace font. You will be given a single-lined text and the expected justification width. The longest word will never be greater than this width.

// Here are the rules:

//     Use spaces to fill in the gaps on the left side of the words.
//     Each line should contain as many words as possible.
//     Use '\n' to separate lines.
//     Gap between words can't differ by more than one space.
//     Lines should end with a word not a space.
//     '\n' is not included in the length of a line.
//     Last line should not contain '\n'


// function alignRight(text,width){
    
//   }
// console.log(alignRight("Two lines, I am",10))


let nu=123
console.log(parseInt("100011",2))
console.log(nu.toString(2))
